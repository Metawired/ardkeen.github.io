  <h2 class="display-5">How to get started</h2>
  <p>Explore some <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/explore/projects/all">sample projects</a> on the Scratch page</p>
  <h2 class="display-5">Installing Scratch</h2>
  <p>Scratch has an online and an offline version. The online version is good for preview and quick remixes but it often crashes without saving so we'd recommend you install and use the <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/scratch2download/">offline version</a> instead. Please make sure that Scratch is installed before attending any sessions as this can save time.</p>
  <h2 class="display-5">First Steps</h2>
  <p>Get familiar with scratch software by reading the <a href="http://kata.coderdojo.com/images/6/69/Beginner_Scratch_Sushi.pdf">Scratch Introduction</a> material. If you are ready and finished initial training ask your mentors for challenge task. You can always ask our mentors for help.</p>
